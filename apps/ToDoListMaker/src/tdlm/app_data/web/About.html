        <h2>About</h2>
        
        <p>The @Todo List Maker is a desktop Java application for creating and
            editing @todo lists. The list is presented in a table and items in the
            list can be moved up or down or removed altogether.
            
            It is the brain child of the one and only Richard McKenna. 
            His intention for this project was to destroy the will of pathetic C.S. majors 
            who foolishly decided to take this 4 credit course in the scope of a 
            summer session. May their souls rest in peace.
